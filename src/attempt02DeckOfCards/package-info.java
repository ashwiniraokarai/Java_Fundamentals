/** Building on the existing deck of cards program but with a better data structure 
 * Card objects will be instantiated as a multi- dimensional array in the DeckOfCards object
 * This will enable DeckOfCards object to save the 52 Card objects and save their states while 
 * still utilizing the 13 iteration inner for loop and 4 iteration outer for loop
