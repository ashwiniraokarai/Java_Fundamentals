/**
 * A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods. 
 * Through these object interactions, a program can carry out various tasks, such as implementing a GUI, 
 * running an animation, or sending and receiving information over a network. 
 * 
 * Once an object has completed the work for which it was created, its resources are recycled for use by other objects.

 *Here's a small program, called CreateObjectDemo, that creates three objects: 
 *one Point object and two Rectangle objects. 
 *You will need all three source files to compile this program.
 * 
 * Detailed explanation of the reasoning behind the program design, object interaction/ control flow can be found here:
